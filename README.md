# Reinforcement Learning in Recommendation Systems
### Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project that explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Recommendation Systems. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in various domains, including e-commerce, content streaming, and online advertising. RL techniques offer a promising approach to enhance the performance of recommendation systems by optimizing user engagement and satisfaction.

In this project, we leverage big data frameworks and RL algorithms to build and evaluate recommendation systems. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing RL-based recommendation systems.

## Introduction
Recommendation systems are essential in delivering personalized content and products to users. Traditional recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, have limitations in handling complex user behavior and evolving preferences. Reinforcement Learning, a subfield of machine learning, offers a dynamic and adaptable approach to recommendation systems.

This project aims to explore various RL techniques, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Actor-Critic methods, in the context of recommendation systems. We will investigate how RL can be used to optimize user interactions and improve recommendation quality.

## Prerequisites
Before using the code in this repository, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Apache Hadoop (or another big data framework of your choice)
- Apache Spark
- TensorFlow (or PyTorch, depending on the chosen RL library)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and visualizing experiments)
